# Place to save binaries that work(ed).
* Files stored in the following folders can be stored in the SDCard and installed using the *Launcher*
* It is not guaranteed that these binaries can be flashed directly (using esphome.io, or huhn.me or esptool) to the device. 

* Open a PR adding the binaries you have found (and work) on the device folder.
* Credits to the original binaries devs, It is just a place to keep the files that work with the Launcher.
